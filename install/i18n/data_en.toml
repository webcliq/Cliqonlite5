		The install routine for Cliqon Lite is automatically displayed if the Configuration file does not yet exists.<br/><br/>

		In order to install Cliqonlite the following tasks need to be undertaken. The program can create an Sqlite database but cannot automatically create a SQL database of any type. You should create that database manual and record the usual details required by any connection.<br/><br/>

		One of the main advantages of a Cliqon Lite system is that it is automatically prepared for multiple languages. For each language you need a unique two letter code and the name of the language. Cliqon Lite automatically provides flag icons as PNG for the most popular languages.<br/><br/>

		You must create an Administrative User to access the system and as part of the process of storing a secure password you should enter a secret key, which will also be the base secret for the JSON Web Token.<br/><br/>

		Some configuration items that you have set will be displayed in the Configuration file, which is stored in TOML format you will have the opportunity to make further changes to the draft configuration file before saving it as the final configuration. Whereupon the website should reload the opening screen of the website.<br/><br/>

		The install routine automatically checks the existence of all the Directories in the system that need to be "writeable". The results of this check are show below. If any entries are marked in <strong style="color: red;">red</strong>, please correct the problem and refresh this page to check again.
